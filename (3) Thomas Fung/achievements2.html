	<p> Aberdeen Centre is a shopping mall in Richmond, BC. The original building was built in 1989 and it contained 50 to 75 stores. The name of the mall referred to a part of Hong Kong, known as Aberdeen. In 2006, it was bought by Thomas Fung's Fairchild Group. They built studios for Fairchild TV and radio in the mall. Over time, Aberdeen Centre has risen up to become one of the largest and most well-known asian malls in Vancouver. <a href="#honors"> Next section. </a> </p>
